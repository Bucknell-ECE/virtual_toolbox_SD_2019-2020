### Documentation ReadMe

In the HTML folder is a doxygen generated code documentation in a HTML format. It makes for easy viewing of the documentation 
and class diagrams related to each class and file for the database tools.

The best way to lauch the HTML tool to view the documentation is to clone the repository then navigate into the html folder. From there 
double click on the index.html file which will take you to the main page. From there you will be able to view the code documentation in
a more pleasing fashion than in a code editor. To see all the documentation for all the files, navigate to the Files tab at the top and
select all files. This will show you a list of all the files, and a link that will take you to all the functions for each file.
