Callback function needs to have something that allows for a change in function depending on the
data param that is passed in.

Need to have some wrapper functions that will build queries for me and make it a tad bit easier.

Things I need to be able to do.
Chceck what is not there (Use select and not in command)
Register new tools

Maybe just have these two things checked when the object is created.  Consider making
the db object a singleton.
Create a new table
Create a new database
