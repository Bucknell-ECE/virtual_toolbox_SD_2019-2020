What else needs added:
ins:
We have the basic tool registration giving an ID and a Name.
We have the basic ability to search for missing tools.
NEED A WAY TO SHOW BOX CLOSED

outs:
We have a way to send a list of missing tool names to the UI after we process them


TODO:
Write some functions that will aid in our unit test.
    All that test code that will allow me to run my tests with relative ease
Write a function that will remove a thing


How could the system Fail?
1. The missing tool detection command is larger than 1000000 bytes.
    * This would need detected and split into two commands
    * However this is very unlikey to happen. We would need thousands of tools
    to exceed this.
2. Can any changes be corrupted?
    * IDK just pull the plug on it a few times and see what happens to appease Cheville


UNIT TEST PROCEDURES:
How many tools if there is a number would cause a problem when we want to search for lost
tools. This would allow us to determine the upper limit of tools we can support and what degree
we can guarantee success of our system.
    * Will create databases with varying number of tools. 300, 500, 1000, 10000. Any number of tools
    is assumed to be out of the scope of this project.
    * We will then compute the average time to find one tool, 5 tools, 10 tools and 15 tools, over
    10 trials for each missing tool number.
    * The resulting operations will be timed to help determine the upper limit of our capabilities
    to search for missing tools.
    * An upper limit will be defined when we are no longer able to achieve 100% certainty of
    the missing tools given a list of present tools
    * We will also take notice to any operation that takes more than 1.5 seconds. This is to
    ensure quick response time of the system.
Could the database be corrupted if a power failure occurred during a tool check or the registration
of tools?
    * If so how can we make sure that this doesnt happen?
